- 👋 Hi, I’m @magnusjyrkkanen
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about game development, AI, and .NET development. I created this profile mostly for learning new things and revisiting some old things.
- 🏢 Currently I'm working as a software developer, where I mostly work with .NET and AI projects.
- 🚀 In the future I would like to work with data, AI, game development, or some combination of those.
